        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            BibTech began as a personal project in 2023 when our founder, an avid reader, struggled to keep track of their growing book collection.
            What started as a simple database quickly evolved into a comprehensive library management system with a vision to serve readers worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, BibTech continues to grow and improve, guided by feedback from our community of users who share our passion for books and reading.
